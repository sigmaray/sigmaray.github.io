title: "Few useful links for rails developers: BEM, CSS Modules, jQuery Components"
---
I had a very positive experience with both CSS modules and BEM (it doesn't make sense to mix them, in legacy projects you can use BEM, in new projects it would be better to use CSS modules).

Nowadays it doesn't make sense to use SASS/SCSS cascades, they create a lot of problems. I try to keep CSS specificity as low as possible and avoid <code>!important</code>

I found few useful articles on this topic, want to share them.
