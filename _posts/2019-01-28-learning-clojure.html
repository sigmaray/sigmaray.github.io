I started to look at Clojure few years ago. My mistakes where reading wrong books and procrastinating on writing Clojure code.

Clojure has alien syntax. When you work with imperative programming languages for a few years you think that you already know everything in programming, you imagine that you can learn any programming language in a few weeks. It's an illusion, it will not work with lisps. You have to forget everything you know.

I started from these books:
<br/ ><br/ >
<a href="https://pragprog.com/book/shcloj3/programming-clojure-third-edition">Programming Clojure</a>
<br/ >
I don't remember why I didn't like it, I tried to read it few years ago. Perhaps I didn't like drinking from fire hydrant.

Too thick.

<br/ >
Too much text. In many chapters half of the text is big boring example. Solving small problems is good, but I don't like big and boring problems.

Some time ago I found better books and articles:
<br/ ><br/ >
<a href="https://aphyr.com/tags/Clojure-from-the-ground-up">Aphyr's introduction into Clojure</a>
<br/ >
I suggest to start from this one. Excellent tutorial.
<br/ ><br/ >
After you finish Aphyr's tutorial, you can read <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/the-joy-of-clojure-second-edition">Joy of Clojure</a>, it's a nice book for learning advanced topics..

For me just reading books didn't work. Reading didn't help me to understand Clojure code.
I had an enlightenment after solving 50 problems onÂ <a href="http://www.4clojure.com/">4clojure.com</a>. I began from "elementary" problems", then switched to "easy". "Easy" problems are already pretty hard. Then I solved all <a href="https://github.com/functional-koans/clojure-koans">Clojure Koans</a> and began to write simple web applications using Compojure, Hiccup.. There is excellent tutorial on Heroku website: <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/clojure-web-application">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/clojure-web-application</a>

There is endless circle. You are afraid to write Clojure code because you didn't understand it's syntax. You keep reading books forever. You read more and more books, and you are still not able to write Clojure code. To end this endless loop, you should start to write simple problems even if you don't understand 50% of the language. More Clojure code you write, more understanding you will gain. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
